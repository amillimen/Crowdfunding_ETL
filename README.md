## Short Description:

- The ETL mini project focuses on building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions for data extraction and transformation. Completed in collaboration with a partner, the project involves creating four CSV files, which are then used to design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema for uploading the data into a Postgres database.

- The main steps of the project are as follows:

1. Category and Subcategory DataFrames: Extract and transform data from an Excel file to create DataFrames for categories and subcategories, each with unique identifiers, then export them as CSV files.
2. Campaign DataFrame: Transform campaign data from the Excel file, including details such as contact information, descriptions, financials, and dates, and export it as a CSV.
3. Contacts DataFrame: Extract contact information from a separate Excel file using either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions, creating a DataFrame that includes contact IDs, names, and emails, and export it as a CSV.
4. Crowdfunding Database: Design an ERD and table schema based on the CSV files, then create a Postgres database. Import the CSV data into the corresponding tables and validate the data.
